Once there lived a king,who went trekking in the forest near the river.On his way he saw a monk sitting under a tree with his tiger.When the monk saw the king,he was pleased by his arrival,he called all his devotees and intorduced the king and all the people in the forest treated the king well.All of them wished the king a good fortune and bid him goodbye
